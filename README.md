# LineFollowingRobot_HandGrip
Line-following Robot with Hand-grip 
This code is intended for a robot (programmed in Arduino) that follows a curved black line. When faced with the end of the track on a double black line, the robot captures a golf ball that is positioned on top of a golf tee, using a 3D-printed arm connected to a servo. It then turns around, and when it gets back to where it started, the robot drops the golf ball at the start position (deteced using a double black line as well).
